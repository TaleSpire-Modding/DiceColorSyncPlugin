# Dice Color Sync Plugin
This plugin changes the dice color to match the users gesture tool color.

## Usage
Upon changing the color for your gesture tool, the color of your dice will change. If another player changes their gesture tool color the dice will match too. This is completely client side so it won't change for other people unless they have the plugin installed to.
